The [Fault in Our Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars) (by John Green) narrates the kind of love story that hits me right in the feels. 
In the book, the lives of two teenagers, Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, get tightly entagled. Both of their lives mainly focused around cancer. It is this common enemy of life that sparked their encounter at Cancer Kid Support Group.

Despite a tumor-shrinking medical miracle that bought Hazel a few years, she has never been anything but terminal. 
In the storry she struggles whether or not she wants to be a grenade for Augustus. She does not want to fall hopelessly in love with Augustus, and explode his life once cancer catches up in her endless race for more good days.

<!--This book confronted me with two dillema's. The first one is explicitly tackled in the book; *"Is unconditionally love possible even if you like the other person so much that you don't want to hurt him/her?"* The second dilemma is implicitly present throughout the whole book; *"How to deal with the finiteness of life?"*-->

## Infinities

This book confronted me mainly with the dillema of how to deal with the finiteness of life. However, as the book (and the movie) suggestes, one does not have to consider life as something finite. In its essence, one can divise infinitely many rational number between 0 and 1. Yet, the infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 5 seems to be bigger. It appears that just **some infinities are bigger than other infinities**. The infinity that is Hazel her life, is considerable smaller than for most people.  

I started thinking, with this perspective in mind, about the limited time that we perceive to have in our lives. I believe that life is not just a finite path towards a destination, where or what that even may be. Life is about the journey. It is about how we fill the infinity in the limited perception of what is life.

## Terminal

Being confronted with Hazel Grace her terminal cancer made me think of another book; [When breath becomes air](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air) (by Paul Kalanithi). This book tells the story of Paul, a terminal lung cancer patient who, in addition to being a neurosurgeon, also has a degree in English literature. He wrote this book in his last year of life. It is about the meaning of life, how to deal with the approaching death, and how he changed from doctor to patient. You are touched by his integrity, his realistic vision, his determination and his humanity. 
I would recommend this book as a must-read for terminally ill people or others who have already been in contact (not necessarily directly) with cancer.

Thinking back to when I enjoyed reading Paul Kalanithi his book, made me realize two things. 
Firstly, I look forward to when most of the lovely and emotional memories to this book have evaporated, so that I can read it again. 
Secondly, I started reflecting on when one is considered as terminal. At first I considered only people who were medically labeled as incurable as actual terminal. But in the broader context of life, **aren't we all terminal**? With this view in mind, I started to think about my death. I feel that it is important to come at peace with yourself, this includes finding peace in the fact that there is an end to our seemingly infinite life.
It is therefore, I advise to everyone to read either (or both) the *The Fault in Our Stars* and *When Breath Becomes Air*, and not just to the medically terminal labeled people.
