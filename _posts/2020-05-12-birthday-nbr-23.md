Exactly one year ago, we went for an adventurous run. On this run, we both shared our common love for nature. This year, we want to take it one *step* further, by reflecting together on some impactful moments of the last 366 days.

Everybody likes to write about himself, since you have complete control on how you are perceived. Therefore, we will spice things up a little, by writing about each other.

## Jeroen (by Jonas)

Jeroen has always been extremely driven and passionate. This year, his perseverance was as strong as ever, sparking in every project and task that came upon his path. However, Jeroen did lose, in some way, his vision for the big picture. He realizes that being a student is a large part of his identity, taking up most of his daily life, but will soon come to an end.

Being lost, made Jeroen search for new experiences in which he could find things he valued; meaning, pleasure, passion, and relationships with others. In that way, Jeroen started reading more books, of all categories, and became in my eyes *booksmart*. Books broadened his vision which allowed the dunning-kruger effect to drip in, giving him a more down-to-earth vision. Jeroen loves to share experiences with others. I can think back of all the times he enthusiastically ran to me with something he cooked up in the microwave and wanted to share with me, looking intrigued to see my reaction. This also applies to his schoolwork, and book reading experiences (of mostly non-fiction books), asking for opinions about certain topics, and trying to awe me with newly obtained concepts. It came to the point that he sparked my interests in books … and made me fall in love with it.

Jeroen’s summer internship was an eyeopener; he looked at what possibly awaited him. The passion he has (for his studies), and hopes to find in his work, was nearly nowhere to be found. Some employees were excessively checking social media during work hours, others playing games on their phones. Jeroen simply couldn’t identify with such an undisciplined mentality. However, he did enjoy the working atmosphere, and niceness of the colleagues. This made Jeroen put extra pressure on himself to look for a job which is aligned with his values.

Jeroen also started experimenting with some sports (badminton/frisbee), but couldn’t find the right combination of social connection and level of competitiveness without being limited in some way by his disability.

In the last few months, Jeroen also encountered some bumps in his [journey](vanderdonckt.info). Most of these bumps were relatively small ones and came from various areas, e.g., bad luck with planned activities (due to COVID-19), troubles finding the “right” job, struggles looking for a fulfilling sport. Additionally, Jeroen was confronted more than ever with his disability, these experiences even changed his opinion on it.
If I were to summarize Jeroen, I would say that he is a caring, passionate dude with a romantic soul. He radiates a constant grind for self-improvement, which actually is addictive because Jeroen lives to share his passion with others. Jeroen’s emotional intelligence and rationality makes him the ideal person to confide to. Over the last year, Jeroen found more beauty and love in small things, enjoying moments to the fullest. All these properties add up to a person with whom I want to share many more experiences. For the next year I truly hope that he keeps on enjoying the journey.

## Jonas (by Jeroen)

Jonas his 22nd life-year was one of big shifts; he transitioned from student to PhD researcher, from being emotionally inexpressive to acknowledging his romantic self, from shy to outgoing, from virgin to …

These shifts did not occur without the (un)necessary hassle. I remember Jonas riding a roller-coaster with many ups and downs. Despite the bumpy ride, I’m sure Jonas enjoyed every single step he took in the journey that is his life.
I believe many of last year’s transitions occurred due to new habits he picked up; reading (more), taking salsa classes, joining the local youth movement, and focusing on life hygiene (e.g., fixing sleep schedule, caring about food, …).

In the first two months of Jonas his 22nd year, he was still a student. In July, he finished a major chapter of his life by graduating. Although I’m sure that Jonas will never stop learning, he will (probably) never be a student again.
I believe that school always stood on a high pedestal for Jonas. Considering his immense perseverance, you can imagine how hard he pushed and put his soul into his schoolwork. I would even say, that in the past 3-4 years, Jonas his life revolved mainly around school. It was in this period that he discovered and developed his passion for scientific research. I will never forget how Jonas got immersed in nearly every school project, always going for that extra mile. On a frequent basis, I still see equivalent passion for his work twinkle in his eyes.

In the summer Jonas (re)discovered another aspect of life; being socially involved. He joined the local youth movement as a (substitute) leader. Gradually, over the summer and the first months of his PhD, Jonas grew more and more into a socially outgoing personality.
It was also in this summer that Jonas gave in to his (hopeless) romantic soul and discovered how wonderful it feels to fall in love.

In the first month(s) of his PhD Jonas was confronted with the Imposter-Syndrome. The root cause for this problem, might be that Jonas compared himself (a little) too much to his experienced new colleagues. By opening up about this, sharing his vulnerabilities, Jonas is addressing this feeling step by step.
It was also in this period that Jonas started taking on new challenges that put him out of his comfort zone, e.g., salsa classes, mindfulness, becoming a vegetarian, (more) sport. Through these experiences, Jonas learned more about himself and continued to develop his identity.

If I were to summarize Jonas, I would describe him as a hopeless romantic that (sometimes) is impulsive. Yet, his thought process is very rational, up to the level that he tends to overthink. Jonas has always been a curious person, resulting in being very eager to learn. When you add his perseverance to the equation, you obtain a very driven (and oriented) person who is passionate about almost every aspect of his life. This translates into Jonas his personality radiating peace and ease in a lovely manner.

Finally, we both started valuing relationships more. We realize that relationships are the single most important thing in life.
To that end, we became more open of our feelings, sharing our vulnerabilities and personal challenges with others. Enabling to connect with them on a deeper level.
