First and foremost, I want to explicitly make clear that I have nothing against masturbation, actually masturbation is really good [[1]](#kaestle-role). But have you ever tried to masturbate without using porn? At least I did, and it didn't feel the same. My own fantasies didn't suffice "to get really going". I needed porn to become properly horny, I was dependent on it. This awareness enabled me to acknowledge my addiction to masturbating to porn, which on its turn caused me to question whether porn is healthy.

After some online research on this topic, I found the reddit [NoFap community](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/), whose goal is to endorse total renouncement from porn and masturbation, also known as *PMO (Porn, Masturbation, Orgasm; and explicitly in that order)*. Their main point is that porn (and masturbation) has several negative effects on our mental and physical health. An uncomplete collection of these effects are:

* PMO creates a wrong image of what sexuality is and how healthy sex should be like [[2]](#guy-internet).
* PMO makes you (at least me) dishonest (by keeping it a secret) and thus makes you feel "dirty".
* PMO is a way of choosing the least resistant path, it is the most effortless gratification of your sexual drive.

I believe it is very important to focus on the underlying motivation of the NoFap community. Everybody wants to improve their life. However, most people seem to get lost in the step between intent and putting it into action. NoFap members acknowledge that they have a "bad habit" **and take action** to change their lives; this is what separates them from the rest. Additionally, restraining from an addiction, is limit testing your willpower and allows to build up discipline.

Note that the title explicitly says I quitted masturbation to porn, as it is not part of my identity. I did this deliberately to enforce the mindset that I don't fap to porn anymore. If I state that I'm trying to quit masturbating to porn, I somehow tell you that *PMO* is still a part of me. It is all about getting in the right mindset. *We will cover more about this in a later blog post*

Thus I distance my self from masturbation to porn. Yet, that does not mean, in contradiction to the NoFap community, that I renounce masturbation in its whole. As a side effect of quitting masturbating to porn, my masturbation frequency has dropped significantly. But, as I believe (and is backed up by science [[1]](#kaestle-role)) masturbation has several benefits. It is therefore that I want to state explicitly that I will be masturbating in the future, just not to porn.

### Conclusion

I want to stress that you will not miraculously change your life by quitting masturbation. But as you conquer this battle, you will feel more confident and ready to take on other challenges, create new healthier habits and even tackle some other bad habits. My longest no-porn/no-masturbation streak is a little over 40 days. As I said before, I do not encourage semen retention. This streak was a way to reboot my system. From then on I started masturbating on a regular basis, **without pornography**. If someone said to me one year ago that I would be able to have such a long streak, or even write this post, I would have deemed that absolutely impossible. I hope this might be an inspiration for others; no matter in what position you are, you can work on you now!

A few days ago, I broke my 30+ no-porn/masturbation streak ... intentionally. I didn't look up my normal

## Short term vs long-term gratification

Another interesting concept I learned from Atomic Habits is the trade-off between short-term vs long-term gratification. Our brain, emotions tend to favor the first over the latter. Yet, in the long term, this short-term gratification is disadvantageous for us, e.g., in the short-term we prefer gaming over studying, while it is clear that studying will result in better prospects in the futures.
