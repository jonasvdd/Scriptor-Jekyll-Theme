 The book Atomic Habits by James Clear introduces an easy to grasp hands-on guide on how to create lasting habits. An atomic habit is considered to be a building block of a larger system of habits. When more and more of these habits (consistently) pile up, it becomes easier to pick up new habits. This is the true power of atomic habits. They are the building blocks for your growth and the development of other (atomic) habits. Just as atoms they stick together to build a stronger structure.

 The key takeaways from this book are:

 * **Identity**: A habit becomes your identity. Don't think identity is something static that merely changes over decades. I've seen my brother change his identity over a single summer going from being completly introvert to being an outgoing, active person. It is important to make habits part of your identity. Suppose someone offers you a cigarette. Saying a) 'No, I want to quit smoking' or b) 'No, I'm not a smoker' will likely have the same outcome in this situation. Yet the latter will have a bigger change of succeeding in quitting. Saying (and believing) that you are not a smoker, makes you (at least) think that you belong the the group of people who don't smoke. Feeling associated with a culture/group where your behavior is seen as normal increases your changes of maintaining good habits.  
 * **Structure**: Environment is really important! In the right environment good habits will sprout, grow and flourish. While in a bad or unstructured environment it becomes a lot harder to maintain or even start habits.  
 * **Planning**: Having a fixed plan for when and/or where to do a habit, significantly increases the chance of actual performing the habit.  
 * **Awareness**: Being aware of your habits (either good and bad ones) is the start of growth. Becoming aware enables you to reflect upon the things you could/should change. Knowledge of existing good habits can be leveraged for stacking (planning) other habits upon (after) them. Whereas for bad habits you can become aware of the cues (environment, time, ...) that causes them. This information can be exploited to rearrange your environment, so that starting your bad habits become harder. It can also be beneficial to think about the consequences coupled to your bad habits. Saying these aloud everytime just before you are about to perform your bad habit, will create a harder barrier to cross.  
 * **Rewards**: It are rewards (at the end of some behaviour) that will be remembered. Hence, it is important that good habits are associated with some rewards. The tricky thing is that rewards for most good habits aren't apparent in the near future (e.g. going 3x a week to gym -> visible body changes, dieting -> weight loss, learning a language -> progress). Since our brains are still (due to evolution) programmed to favor short-term gains over long-term ones, it is really hard to see these future goals as rewards. Conversly most bad behaviors are coupled to immediate rewards (e.g. smoking -> stress-relief, drinking -> relaxation/coming loose, ...). Being able to attach some reward to those long-term habits is essential for sticking with them!  
 * **Tracking**: Habit tracking is something tricky. First of all tracking a habit is actually a habit itself. Secondly this is a means to attach some reward to a habit.  

Note that the above list isn't at all exhaustive and is written down without consulting the book as reference.
