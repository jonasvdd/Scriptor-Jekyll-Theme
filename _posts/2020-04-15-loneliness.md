Everybody of us experiences feelings of loneliness at some point in their lives. This feeling is experienced amongst all ages.
Having a clear view on the underlying concepts and consequences enables one to think about this subject. With this post, we want to break through the controversy around this topic. As cliché as it sounds, talking openly about this with each other may be an underestimated part of the solution.

This post idea was crafted upon being touched by the stories in the *[Eenzaam](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnu/a-z/eenzaam/)* documentary. We watched the episodes together, discussing and reasoning on the participant's storylines. Writing this blog post sparked us to open up to each other by sharing moments where we felt at our loneliest. We hope this post can be a virtual hug (in these COVID-19 times :wink:), helping you to cope with your past, current and future experiences with loneliness.

## The discrepancy

Everybody is sometimes alone, however this is not the same as loneliness. There is a large difference between loneliness and being alone.
*Loneliness* is a negative state. In scientific literature **loneliness is described as the negative feeling that arises when there is a discrepancy between the experienced and the desired quality of social contacts**. Each person has its own expectations, thus making loneliness a very subjective feeling [[1]](#perlman_d_toward).
In contrast, *solitude* (or being alone) refers to the objective situation where no one is around. People are alone when they cannot exchange information or feelings with others. Solitude can be either positive, e.g., boost creativity, or negative, e.g., long durations of solitude tend to result in feelings of loneliness.

As loneliness and solitude are two different states, there is no conditional requirement between them.
On the one hand, you don't have to feel lonely when you're alone. But on the other hand, you can feel very lonely when you are surrounded by many others. In that case, you are not satisfied with the quality of your relationships.

### Is it bad for you?

An important concept in scientific research is the evolutionary theory of loneliness. This theory states that loneliness had an important role in the evolution of our human species [[2]](#cacioppo_j_Lonely).
The fact that we can feel lonely helps us to adapt to our social environment, giving us a better chance of survival.
This theory assumes that we humans are social beings.
Hence, **loneliness can be considered as a warning system**; it signals that we miss something in our social relationships.

To answer the question *'Is loneliness bad for you?'*, it is important to make a distinction based on the duration of the loneliness [[2]](#cacioppo_j_Lonely). In the short term, it's good that we can experience loneliness because it signals to us that something is missing and motivates us to take action.
<!-- Just as the unpleasant sensation of hunger, loneliness stimulates you to act upon it and thus resolve the feeling. -->

If one is not able to resolve its underlying problems, loneliness will gradually become more and more an obstruction for you. In this case, we talk about longitudinal loneliness. The problem with this long-term version of loneliness is that it becomes self-sustaining, thus resulting in a vicious circle.
People who feel lonely seem to have a negative cognitive bias, which affects their interpretation and memories of social situations. This leads to a more introvert and less (emotionally) stable lifestyle, which on its turn self-sustains longitudinal loneliness.
<!--People tend to perceive more (false) signs of social threat that others don't and remain more distant to protect themselves from negative experiences.-->
Next to this, long-term loneliness is associated with several mental and physical health problems; lower self-esteem, depressive symptoms, more suicidal thoughts, a higher risk of early death [[3]](#hawkley_l_perceived). As a reference, being lonely in the long term is equal, in terms of physical damage, to smoking a pack of cigarettes every day.

## Loneliness & social media
<!-- TODO: scientific references -->

From an evolutionary perspective, animals always tend to display their best side within their society [[4]](#gunduz_u_identity). Social media enabled the *homo sapiens* species to control the way one is perceived in a manner that is perfectly in line with western individualism. In the latter, each person is a unique entity with own values, opinions and freedom.
Nearly all of us will only share the best, most successful, and happiest moments of our lives with others. Several studies have shown that people experiencing loneliness increase their social media usage, as they (implicitly) think it is a way to fulfill their social needs. This has a detrimental effect on their mental health, as these persons will see that *everybody is happy and experiencing life at its fullest, whilst they feel lonely*. Social media induces **Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)**, reshaping lonely persons' expectations into 'experiences' depicted in the pixels on their screen [[5]](#hunt_m_fomo).

## Our take

First and foremost, loneliness should not be a taboo. We to stress that it is fine to feel lonely from time to time. Talking openly about this with others and identifying the root causes of these feelings is a significant part of the solution.

### Identity & expectations

We believe that loneliness is tightly entangled with one's identity and expectations. Both of these are mostly shaped by ones image of society.

When people have a lack of identity, they tend to behave in a needy manner. This results in unattractiveness. Such a person changes his behavior to obtain the likes of others (which he/she wants so bad), making him/her uninteresting by always complying with opinions of others.
Next to this, people with a lack of identity identify themselves, as sheep in a herd, with the images of their society or the identity of relatives. Based on these (wrong) identity principles, outside themselves, they create expectations. This has two possible outcomes;
1. If that person manages to achieve these expectations, he/she will not reflect on whether this is what he/she really wants. Yet, they will find peace by living up to the projected stigmas of their perception.
2. These people's identity are solely based on external concepts/people on which they have limited control. Once these external factors fail them by either disappearing or not being able to live up to them, they will end up with an identity crisis. Additionally, they will blame only themselves, and thus not consider whether their projected self-image is correct.

## Final notes

Here are our main takeaways:
* Build an identity (that does not solely rely on others):
  e.g., husband can be part of your identity, but it should not be your whole identity
  * Embrace the current individualism society & figure out what really matters to you, your values, and what you like to do, ... **and act upon it!**
* Distance yourself more from social media, as this can heavily influence your self-image by comparing with others
* Practice some self-love; if you aren't able to love yourself, why should others be interested in building relationships with you

Finally, just see life as an amazing [journey](https://vanderdonckt.info) where connecting with people is like **treasure hunting**.
