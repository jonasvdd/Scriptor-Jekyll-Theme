*Journeys* is a shared blog by **Jonas & Jeroen Van Der Donckt**. We are brothers, more specifically (identical) twins. 
Most of our life we spent a great amount of our time together. Since 2014, slowly but surely, our paths started to separate. We both pursued our studies at different universities, created (somewhat) separate friend groups, and discovered our own passions.

## What you can expect

In this blog we will publish opinions we share, but also criticize each other's values, write about life-changing experiences, opinions, book reviews, and (perhaps) many more.
We intend to use this blog as a means to reflect upon things we (individually) value. **The main purpose of this blog is to find peace in the wild ride that is each of our muddled lives.**

## Why this is a shared blog

Some articles tackle certain topics in which we are both highly invested. In that case, writing helps us to connect and create lasting memories. Luckily, we do not share the same opinion on everything. Thus many articles will tackle individual experiences, opinions, and book reviews.
