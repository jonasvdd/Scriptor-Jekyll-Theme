A couple of months ago, I officially graduated. To be fair, I planned to finish (and publish) this blogpost a lot earlier. But as I missed a sense of completement in these bizarre (COVID-19) times, I kept postponing this post. Now, I believe that today is just as good as any other day to publish.

## My school career

<!--more-->

### The competition

School always stood on a high pedestal for me. For most of my school career I considered school as some sort of competition. Until my 16'th year, I was in the same class as Jonas (with a small exception of 1 year in kindergarten). We always competed for the best possible results. Although the short-term outcome was great, i.e., I learned a lot, my motivation to study was completely misaligned. This became obvious in the following three years (16 - 19 years), I lost the sense that school was a competitive environment and thereby I did also lose my motivation to study properly. 

### Passion

Luckily, this misaligned motivation gradually faded away when I fell more and more in love with learning in the last years (19 - 23 years). During my studies at the university I got in touch with many subjects where I became passionate about. Once an interest was sparked for a subject, it felt natural to learn more about it. In my opinion, discovering this characteristic is the most important experience I had during my school career.

*Although I will never be a student again, I am still sure that I will continue to deepen my interest in topics I am passionate about.*

### Discipline 

The most important skill I cultivated during my school career is discipline. I believe that discipline is the foundation of any good habit. Whenever you pick up a new hobby, start learning or training a new skill, there will always be some moments where you struggle more. Having discipline enables you to persist and not give in (completely) to these harder moments. I would even say that discipline is a prerequisite for success.

## Outlook

Now that school is officially over for me, there is some void left in my life. As I was very passionate about the work I did at school, I wanted to fill this void with other (paid) work in which I see purpose. Hence, I took the opportunity to start as a research engineer at Ghent University,. My reasearch is focused on automating sleep stage classification by interpretable machine learning :zzz:.

After almost two months, I am really grateful for the opportunities and impact I find and see in my work. In advance, I never would have expected that I love researching sleep this much!

**I can only hope that I will always aim for meaningful work throughout my life.**
