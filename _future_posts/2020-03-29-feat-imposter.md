Let's first get our definitions straight

* impostor syndrome
* fear

What i fear:
* Love life --> little to no experience --> fear to lose something makes you desparate & needy -->
* Fear limiting actions -> lost opportunities
* Fear of expressing my true self
* Impostor syndrome -> inducing fear -> self worth -> feedback loop

* Personality test
    -> prudence --> saying it inhibits himself in meetings

* fear & being comfortable -> actions

Imposter --> being brutally honest, playing to your strengths, accepting your true self. I'm not supersmart, but I compensate that by working hard and being passionate. (And being brave when it matters), this is wat makes me human, accepting my flaws. 

Being in love, is for me being able to live with someone, even when they have flaws. 

Your own life is amazing, do not compare it with others
    You don't need to; everybody shows their best side online acts more interesting than they really are. 

> Fear is what makes people superficial
> Fear is what makes you compare yourself with others, go with the flow
> Fear makes you abandon your values
